            <h2>The textual analysis done in this project provides several valuable insights into how females were represented in the incredibly persavive aspect of 19th and early 20th century pop culture, the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories and why that representation changed over time. Through these insights, one can gain a better understanding of the prevailing attitudes towards women in the 19th and early 20th century.</h2>

                <h3>1. <span class="red">Women were Not Granted a Voice</span></h3>
                <p>One of the most significant themes seen in the representation of females in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories is that they often were not represented at all. In all of the publications of <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, women were almost one-fourth of the time men were. Furthermore, when women were represented in the stories, 14% of the time, they were mentioned in the context of men, showcasing the common Victorian ideal that women should always advance men. 
                    <span class="d-inline-block" tabindex="0" data-mdb-toggle="tooltip" title="James Ruddick, Death At The Priory (Ulverscroft, 2002), 47.">
                        <a class="footnote" href="documents/Bibliography.pdf" target="_blank"><sup style="pointer-events: none;" disabled>1</sup></a> 
                    </span>
                    &nbsp;All of this shows that women were not granted much of a voice within the stories, and their voices were only necessary when they were advancing the stories of men.

                <h3>2. <span class="red">Women were Presented in the Context of Stereotypical Female Traits</span></h3>
                <p>Another common theme that appears in the representation of women in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories is that it is likely that they appear in context with the stereotypical female traits of the period, and they are much more likely to appear in context with those traits than men. According to scholar Elaine Showalter, in the Victorian Era, women were “situated on the side of irrationality, silence, nature, and body, while men [were] situated on the side of reason, discourse, culture, and mind.”
                    <span class="d-inline-block" tabindex="0" data-mdb-toggle="tooltip" title="Elaine Showalter, The Female Malady: Women, Madness and English Culture, 1830-1980 (London: Time Warner Books Uk, 1987), 3-4.">
                        <a class="footnote" href="documents/Bibliography.pdf" target="_blank"><sup style="pointer-events: none;" disabled>2</sup></a>
                    </span>
                    &nbsp;This trend that Showalter details appears in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories, with women being twice as likely to appear alongside words denoting irrationality. Along with irrationality, women also were more likely than men to appear alongside words denoting other stereotypical female traits, such as weakness, shyness, and lovingness in the stories. By presenting women this way in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories, Arthur Conan Doyle places them into the box society had created for them, forcing them to only act one way within his stories.

                <h3>3. <span class="red">Female Representation Improved After the Conclusion of the Social Purity Movement</span></h3>
                <p>Another important trend that can be seen in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories is that in almost all facets, representation of women improved after the conclusion of the social purity movement in 1910. Although it still was not great, the total mentions of women had grown much closer to the total mention of men, women appeared independently from men more often, and women became less defined by stereotypical female emotional traits and stereotypical marital expectations. The only aspect in which representation of women did not improve in the period after the social purity movement was their likelihood of showing up in context with words denoting irrationality, but men also became more like to show up in the context of words denoting irrationality, so this is probably indicative of a larger trend going on in society at the time. These overall improvements in the representation of women in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories showcase that when society stopped trying so hard to restrict female sexuality and agency, women were given more of a voice in society and were allowed to become more than the stereotypes society had placed on them.</p>

                <h3>4. <span class="red">Final Thoughts</span></h3>
                <p>As seen in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories, women were not given much of a voice in the 18th and early 19th century. Not only did they appear in the stories much less than men, but often, when they were mentioned, it was only to advance the stories of the men around them. Furthermore, when women did appear, it was in the context of stereotypical female traits attributed to women, such as irrationality, lovingness, and weakness. Although this is only how they were represented by Arthur Conan Doyle in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories, their representation in such a widespread form of pop culture in the 18th and early 19th century can provide a valuable lens into the common societal views regarding women in the period since so much of society accepted and appeared to appreciate how women were represented in the stories.</p>
                <p id="last-p">However, it is crucial to keep in mind that even with all of the insights that textual analysis of the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories can provide about societal attitudes towards women in the 18th and early 19th century, there are still certain limitations to performing a distant reading. For example, although the data shows women often appear in the context of being irrational, a closer reading might prove that it is a coincidence that women are presented in the context of words denoting irrationality. Nonetheless, even though a closer reading might be necessary to fully grasp how women are presented in the <i>Sherlock Holmes</i> stories, the distant reading done in this project of an incredibly pervasive form of pop culture can still help one to understand prevailing views of women in the 18th and early 19th century.</p>
